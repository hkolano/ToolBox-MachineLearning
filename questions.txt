# Answers to the questions posed in the Machine Learning Toolbox

1. What is the general trend in the curve?

The general curve is linearly increasing. As the percentage of test samples
increases, the accuracy increases.

2. Are there parts in the curve that seem to be noisier than others? Why?

The beginning of the graph (the lower numbers) are generally noisier. With a
small sample, there are many more combinations of which examples were taken for
training. So whereas one iteration might get a bunch of 8's to train on, it
might get 8's pretty well but not the others. Conversely, it might get a decent
spread of all of them and be more accurate overall. It just depends on what
sample it takes. When the proportion grows, there are less possible combinations
of trainings, so the results are more consistent.

3. How many trials do you need to get a smooth curve?

Depends on the definition of smooth, I guess. At 20 trials it's pretty
consistent trial-to-trial, but it's not until around 50 trials that the curve
itself smooths out.

4. Try different values for C. What happens?

When the C value is smaller, the accuracy drops. When it is larger, the
accuracy increases. This leads me to believe that it has something to do with
what the program counts as "accurate".
